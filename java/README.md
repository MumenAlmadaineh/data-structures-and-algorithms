# Insert to Middle of an Array
We need have an array from user and a value and but the value in middle position in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? I used a pen and a paper to understand the logic and I type a good Algorithm to improve my logic.

# Code Challenge: Class 03

# Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key,

We have an array, and and a value so we need to know if our value equal to any element in the array if yes we want the index that has the value if not we need to print -1

## Approach & Efficiency
What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? this take from me more than 3 hours I used a pen and a paper to understand the logic and I type a good Algorithm to improve my logic.
